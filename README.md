# 🎨 Basic CSS Projects

Welcome to my collection of **Basic CSS Projects**!  
This repository serves as a personal space where I practice and build small web projects using only HTML and CSS. It's part of my journey as a future **Full Stack Developer**, currently focused on front-end development.

## 📁 What's Inside?

You'll find simple, beginner-friendly projects that explore:

- CSS layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid)
- Styling elements with colors, borders, spacing
- Responsive designs (mobile-first)
- Hover effects and transitions
- Typography and visual hierarchy

I’ll keep adding more projects as I continue learning and improving. 📚✨
